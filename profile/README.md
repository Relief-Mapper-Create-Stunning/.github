## What is Relief Mapper?  

Relief Mapper is a powerful application designed to quickly create, edit, and export high-quality 3D terrain maps from elevation data (DEMs).  
With this tool, designers, cartographers, engineers and hobbyists can visualize landscapes in 3D, prepare models for 3D printing or interactive visualization, and highlight terrain features with texture and depth.

## Key Features  

- 🗺 Import DEMs, satellite imagery and map layers.  
- 🎞 Transform digital elevation models into full 3D terrain objects with navigation, rotation and zoom.  
- 📦 Export maps to OBJ, STL, GLTF formats or high-resolution PNG graphic.  
- 🖥 Customize textures: apply satellite imagery, elevation colours, or stylised map textures.  
- 🖨 Prepare models for 3D printing: export ready-to-print STL/OBJ, optimize mesh.  
- 🧩 Add markers, labels, legends and GIS layers for enhanced cartographic output.
